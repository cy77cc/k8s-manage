## 1. OpenSpec Artifact Bootstrap

- [x] 1.1 Create change `migrate-docs-to-openspec-baseline` with spec-driven schema
- [x] 1.2 Generate and fill proposal/design artifacts for docs migration scope
- [x] 1.3 Define capability list for mapping, platform baseline, AI baseline, and progress governance

## 2. Docs To Capability Migration

- [x] 2.1 Map legacy `docs/` domains into OpenSpec capability structure
- [x] 2.2 Create `docs-to-openspec-mapping` spec with migration requirements and transition rules
- [x] 2.3 Record traceability expectations from legacy docs to new OpenSpec capabilities

## 3. Code-Aligned Baseline Synchronization

- [x] 3.1 Inspect backend route registrations and domain handlers to build platform baseline
- [x] 3.2 Inspect AI routes/handlers and frontend AI API contract to build AI control-plane baseline
- [x] 3.3 Create platform/AI/progress governance specs with status-oriented requirements
- [x] 3.4 Add finer-grained per-domain status appendix (Done/In Progress/Risk) in a follow-up change

## 4. Governance And Next Iteration

- [x] 4.1 Create OpenSpec tasks checklist with completed and pending migration work
- [x] 4.2 Establish PR rule: capability code changes require matching OpenSpec spec/task updates
- [x] 4.3 Split roadmap phase items into dedicated OpenSpec changes (`deployment`, `monitoring`, `automation`) 
- [ ] 4.4 Archive this change after follow-up governance tasks are complete
